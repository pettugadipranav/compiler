# To run the script make sure you place your input code in ./test_case directory with file name <anything>.cplex

Now head to directory where the files are present and run the command
$ make run
This will compile the code and run the executable file with the input as the test case files present in ./test_case directory

You can see the output on the terminal with status as "Passed" or "Failed" for each test case.

You can also see the token files produced in the ./test_case directory with the name <anything>_token.txt
